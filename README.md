# Putting the R in phaRmacy

Inventory management of medicines within hospital pharmacies could be improved by harnessing advanced analytics to inform stock ordering requirements. This should release valuable resources which could be used for higher value clinical work. This project aims to develop, test and implement an open source analytical tool in R that will support and improve existing inventory management practices within our Trust pharmacy.

This repository contains early work forecasting issues of drugs within the Trust (as well as an open dataset). As the project progresses there will be material relating to stock control as well as a Shiny interface to the forecasting and stock control methods.
