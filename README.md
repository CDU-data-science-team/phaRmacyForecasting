# Putting the R in phaRmacy

Inventory management of medicines within hospital pharmacies could be improved by harnessing advanced analytics to inform stock ordering requirements. This should release valuable resources which could be used for higher value clinical work. This project aims to develop, test and implement an open source analytical tool in R that will support and improve existing inventory management practices within our Trust pharmacy.

This Shiny application was too CPU intensive to run in production and this repository has been archived. An [RMarkdown based approach](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/pharmacyReporting) was used instead.

This project is part of the [Health Foundation's](https://www.health.org.uk/) Advancing Applied Analytics programme. The Health Foundation is an independent charity committed to bringing about better health and health care for people in the UK.
